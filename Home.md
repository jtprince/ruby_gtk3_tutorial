This tutorial gives an introduction to writing GTK+ 3 applications in Ruby.

Prior to working through this tutorial, it is recommended that you have a reasonable grasp of the Ruby programming language. GUI programming introduces new problems compared to interacting with the standard output (console / terminal). It is necessary for you to know how to create and run Ruby files, understand basic interpreter errors, and work with strings, integers, floats and boolean values. For the more advanced widgets in this tutorial, good knowledge of lists, blocks and splats will be needed.

Although this tutorial describes the most important classes and methods within GTK+ 3, it is not supposed to serve as an API reference. Please refer to the [GTK+ 3 API](http://rubydoc.info/gems/gtk3).
